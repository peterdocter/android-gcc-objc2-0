#summary Current compiler support and issues.

= Details =

Properties:
  * @property seems to work just fine
  * nonatomic and atomic
  * assign, copy, retain work (granted that requires a NSCopying protocol for copying)
  * getter/setters have not been tested yet
  * @synthesize works 
  * @dynamic has not been tested (but should work since @synthesize does)

Classes:
  * @private works for ivars
  * direct ivar access has not been tested (but it should work since its fairly similar to properties code wise in the compiler)

Protocols:
  * libobjc needs some overhauling to support protocols better (need to re-do libobjc to update to more apple-esque versions)
  * the initial protocol concept works, however there is no identifier for class conformance to a given protocol (properly atleast)

Blocks:
  * Blocks have not been tested in c, c++, objc, or obj-c++ (not even sure they compile right yet)

Fast enumeration (foreach/for-in):
  * Not yet tested at all (also not sure if they compile yet)
